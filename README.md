# Task definition
#### Task 1: Answer generation without using manual descripitions for inference
    You can train models using manual descriptions but CANNOT use them for testing. 
    Video description power needs to be emebedded in the answer generation models.
    
    Data conditions:
    a. Use the provided video including audio and video features, 
       the dialog history and manual video descriptions (scripts and summary) data for training
        - scripts used to instruct actions
        - summary generated by the questioners after holding 10 QAs.
    b. Publicly available external data and pre-trained models may also be used for training as a sub task

#### Task 2: Reasoning temoporal Localization 
    Please generate answers and find audio visual evidences for the answers 

    Data conditions:
    a. Temporal localization information for answer reasoning is provided as begin and end timestamps showing evidence scenes
    b. Any publicly available data and pre-trained models may also be used for training as a sub task.
    
#### Validation data set:

Please train models using the training data set only.
You can tune the parameters using the validation set and confirm the performance of your systems using the DSTC10 test sets.
Notes: The official challenge doesn't allow you to use the DSTC10 test set to tune your models.

|               |    Training    |  Validation   |   DSTC10 Test  |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| # of Dialogs  |       7,659    |      1,787    |      1,710    |   
| # of Turns    |     153,180    |     35,740    |     13,490    |
| # of Words    |   1,450,754    |    339,006    |    110,252    |

*The number of turns for the test set is smaller than the validation
because they are not always full dialogs.
