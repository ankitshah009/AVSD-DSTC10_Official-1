# AVSD-DSTC10 - Task 1 - Video QA dialog

```
Goal: Answer generation without using manual descriptions for inference
You can train models using manual descriptions but CANNOT use them for testing. 
Video description capability needs to be embedded within the answer generation models.

Data conditions:
a. Use the provided video including audio and video features, 
   the dialog history and manual video descriptions (scripts and summary) data for training
    - text descriptions or scripts used by the actor to enact in the videos
    - summary generated by the questioners after holding 10 QAs.

b. Publicly available external data and pre-trained models may also be used for training as a sub task
